Data
--------

Downloaded and unzipped:
  - "UCI HAR Dataset": folder unzipped from Dataset.zip
  - "UCI HAR Dataset"/activity_labels.txt: labels for each of the 6 activities (loaded by run_analysis.R)
  - "UCI HAR Dataset"/features.txt: labels for each measurement found in the test and training datasets (loaded by run_analysis.R)
  - "UCI HAR Dataset"/train/subject_train.txt: subjects ID corresponding to the training dataset (loaded by run_analysis.R)
  - "UCI HAR Dataset"/train/X_train.txt: the training dataset, containing measurements only (loaded by run_analysis.R)
  - "UCI HAR Dataset"/train/y_train.txt: activities codes for the training dataset (loaded by run_analysis.R)
  - "UCI HAR Dataset"/test/subject_test.txt: subjects ID corresponding to the test dataset (loaded by run_analysis.R)
  - "UCI HAR Dataset"/test/X_test.txt: the test dataset, containing measurements only (loaded by run_analysis.R)
  - "UCI HAR Dataset"/test/y_test.txt: activities codes for the test dataset (loaded by run_analysis.R)

Generated by the script:
  - data/tidy.txt: output of the project generated by run_analysis.R; contains a header and 180 rows (30 subjects x 6 activities)
  
Variables Description
---------------------
Result dataset: tidy.txt
  - Subject: subject ID from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt files
  - Activity: activity as a factor from y_train.txt and y_test.txt files
  - All mean measurements in the form ID-(mean|std)[-X|Y|Z], e.g fBodyAcc-mean-X, fBodyBodyGyroMag-std. There are 66 measurements in the tidy.txt dataset. The original measurements come from X_train.txt and X_test.txt.
  
Transformations
---------------
The following steps are performed by run_analysis.R to generate tidy.txt:

  - get data sub-directory
  - read the data sets ( subjects IDs, activities codes, measurements)
  - merge datasets vertically, adding rows but keeping the same columns( subjects IDs, activities codes, measurements)
  - read feature and activity labels
  - add column names
  - renames columns of the merged measurement dataset with the feature labels
  - filter the merged dataset to keep names with mean() or std() in them
  - select the columns to keep and subset by keeping the columns
  - add Subject and Activity columns in front
  - add activity labels to the merged dataset
  - calculate the mean by subject and activity
  - save the tidy dataset

These steps are  mentionned in comments in run_analysis.R
